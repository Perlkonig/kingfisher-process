Kingfisher Process stores and pre-processes OCDS data. An accompanying tool, `Kingfisher Scrape <https://kingfisher-scrape.readthedocs.io>`__, downloads OCDS data from sources, and optionally sends it to Kingfisher Process.

If you are viewing this on GitHub or PyPi, open the `full documentation <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/>`__ for additional details.
